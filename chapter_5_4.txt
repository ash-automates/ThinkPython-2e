Docstring for recurse(n, s):

"""
This function performs a summation operation recursively from 1 up to 'n'
and prints the final result.
Parameters:
- n (int): The integer representing the current recursion level and the
upper limit for summation.
- s (int): The accumulator value that gets updated during each recursion
by adding the current value of 'n'.

Usage:
To use this function, call recurse(n, s) with appropriate integer values
for 'n' and 's'.
Ensure that 'n' is a non-negative integer for proper functioning.
Example:
recurse(3, 0)  # This will perform the summation 1 + 2 + 3 and print the
result 6.
"""

Answer to "1. What would happen if you called this function like this:
recurse(-1, 0)?":
Calling recurse(-1, 0) would immediately print the initial value of the
accumulator 's', which is 0. Since 'n' is negative, the base case of the
recursion (n == 0) is not met, and the function will not enter the
recursive calls. Therefore, the output would be 0 without any further
recursion.
